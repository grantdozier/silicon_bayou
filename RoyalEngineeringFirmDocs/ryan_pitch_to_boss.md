# The 2-Minute Executive Summary

**What They Want to Do:**
Build us a simple tool that extracts data from our Settle3 reports and puts it into Excel automatically.

**Why It Matters:**
- We spend **8 hours per project** manually typing numbers from PDFs into Excel
- With 20 projects per year, that's **160 hours** of engineering time on data entry
- They can fix this in **2 weeks** for **$15,000**

**The Bottom Line:**
- **Cost:** $15,000 (one-time)
- **Time to implement:** 2 weeks
- **Payback:** After just 2 projects
- **Risk:** None - if it doesn't work, they'll refund us

# What Problem Does This Solve?

## Current Situation (What I Do Now)
1. Open Settle3 PDF report (30+ pages)
2. Find settlement data tables
3. Manually type into Excel:
   - 35 time steps
   - Settlement values
   - Elevation data
4. Repeat for 30+ models per project
5. **Time:** 8-10 hours per project
6. **Errors:** ~15% transcription mistakes

## With Their Tool
1. Drop PDF into folder
2. Tool extracts all data automatically
3. Opens completed Excel file
4. **Time:** 5 minutes
5. **Errors:** <1%

# Common Boss Questions (And Answers)

**Q: "What if it doesn't work with our specific formats?"**
A: They customize it during Week 1 using our exact Settle3 files. Plus, money-back guarantee.

**Q: "Do we need IT involvement?"**
A: No. It's like installing Excel. Runs on our computers, no servers needed.

**Q: "What about security?"**
A: All processing happens on our computers. No data leaves our network.

**Q: "Can we trust the accuracy?"**
A: The tool flags any uncertain extractions for human review. We always have final QC control.

**Q: "What if they disappear after the pilot?"**
A: We get the tool installed and working. Even without them, it keeps saving us time.

**Q: "Why not just hire an intern?"**
A: Interns make mistakes, need training, and leave. This tool works 24/7 with 99% accuracy.

# Email Template for Boss

**Subject:** Approval Request - Settlement Data Automation Pilot ($15k)

Hi [Boss name],

I've been investigating ways to reduce the time we spend on manual data entry from Settle3 reports. Currently, each project requires 8-10 hours of manually transcribing settlement data into Excel.

I've found a company that can automate this process. They've demonstrated their tool extracting 1,200 data points from a Settle3 PDF in under a minute (vs. 8 hours manually).

**The Pilot:**
- Cost: $15,000 (one-time)
- Timeline: 2 weeks
- Deliverable: Automated tool that extracts Settle3 data directly to our Excel templates

**ROI:**
- Current cost: $1,200 per project (8 hrs × $150/hr)
- Automated cost: $75 per project (0.5 hrs QC)
- Payback: After 13 projects (~8 months)
- Annual savings: $22,500

**Next Steps:**
They can start next Monday if we approve by Friday. They're also offering a money-back guarantee if we're not satisfied.

Can we discuss this tomorrow? I have their demo video and reference contacts if you'd like to see more.

Thanks,
[Your name]

# Meeting Talking Points

## If Asked to Explain in Person:

### Keep It Simple
"It's like having a perfect assistant who never makes mistakes and can type 1,000 numbers per minute. We drop in a Settle3 PDF, and it fills out our Excel template automatically."

### Focus on Pain
"Remember last month when I spent two days just entering data from the Grand Liard project? This eliminates that completely."

### Address Concerns
"It's not complicated AI or anything scary. It just reads PDFs and fills in Excel. Same process we do now, just automated."

### Create Urgency
"They can only take on one new client this month. If we wait, next opening is in 6-8 weeks."

### Show Confidence
"I've seen it work with our exact files. It's not theoretical - they demonstrated it with our Settle3 reports."

# If Your Boss Says No

## Get Partial Approval:
"Can we at least do the $5,000 proof of concept? Or even just the free demo with our files?"

## Understand Objections:
- Budget? → "What budget would this fit under?"
- Timing? → "When would be better?"
- Trust? → "What would convince you?"

## Keep Door Open:
"I understand. When we're spending another 160 hours on data entry this year, can we revisit this?"
