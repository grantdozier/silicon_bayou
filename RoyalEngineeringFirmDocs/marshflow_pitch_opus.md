# The Problem We Solve

## Current State: Manual Workflow Challenges

### Time Drain Statistics
- **70%** of engineering time spent on data entry
- **1,050** manual data points per settlement project
- **3 weeks** average project timeline
- **15%** error rate in manual transcription

### Specific Pain Points
1. **Settlement Data Extraction**
   - Manual transcription from Settle3 outputs
   - 30+ models × 35 time steps = 1,050 data points
   - Prone to human error and inconsistency

2. **Survey Data Processing**
   - Manual mudline calculations from RTK data
   - Time-consuming AutoCAD extractions
   - Inconsistent quality control

3. **Document Management**
   - Scattered files across Egnyte folders
   - No intelligent search capabilities
   - Version control challenges

4. **Predictive Analysis**
   - Limited forecasting capabilities
   - Manual curve fitting and analysis
   - No early warning systems

# Our Solution: The MarshFlow Platform

## Phase 1: Quick Win - Data Extraction Bot (Weeks 1-3)

### What It Does
Automatically extracts settlement data from Settle3 PDFs and PSDDF reports, eliminating manual transcription.

### Technical Implementation
```python
# Live Demo Code Snippet
from marshflow import Settle3Extractor

# Initialize extractor
extractor = Settle3Extractor()

# Process a Settle3 PDF

# Appendix: Sample Code Integration

## Egnyte File Watcher
```python
# Automatic processing when new files arrive
@egnyte_webhook.on_file_created
def process_new_settlement_file(event):
    if event.file_type == "settle3_output":
        # Download from Egnyte
        file = egnyte.download(event.file_path)
        
        # Extract data
        data = extractor.process(file)
        
        # Save to Excel template
        save_to_template(data, event.project_id)
        
        # Notify team
        send_notification(f"Settlement data processed: {event.project_name}")
```

## AutoCAD Survey Extraction
```python
# Extract survey points directly from DWG files
def extract_survey_from_autocad(dwg_path):
    # Connect to AutoCAD
    acad = Dispatch("AutoCAD.Application")
    doc = acad.Documents.Open(dwg_path)
    
    # Extract all survey points
    points = []
    for entity in doc.ModelSpace:
        if entity.EntityName == "AcDbPoint":
            points.append({
                'northing': entity.Coordinates[1],
                'easting': entity.Coordinates[0],
                'elevation': entity.Coordinates[2]
            })
    
    # Calculate mudline statistics
    mudline_stats = calculate_mudline(points)
    
    return mudline_stats
```
