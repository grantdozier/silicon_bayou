# Productizing AI/ML Solutions for Coastal Engineering

## Step 1: Package the Solution into a Productized Framework

### Name the Service:
- RoyalAI, SettleSense, or MarshFlow

### Create Your Product Framework:
Break down the solution into modules:
1. **Data Extraction Engine**
2. **Survey Intelligence Module**
3. **Forecasting & Curve Analytics**
4. **Document Management Engine**
5. **Visualization Dashboards**
6. **System Integration Layer**

## Step 2: Define Delivery Options

### Tiers:
1. **Pilot / PoC**: $15,000 – $40,000  
   - 1-2 modules  
   - Short timeline  
   - Goal: prove value

2. **Workflow Automation Platform**: $75,000 – $200,000  
   - Full end-to-end system  
   - Includes all core modules  
   - Custom deployment

3. **Managed AI Service**: $3,000 – $8,000/month  
   - Full support and hosting  
   - Monthly updates and dashboards  
   - Includes retraining and performance monitoring

## Step 3: Develop Deployment Model

### Cloud-Hosted Platform:
- Fast onboarding
- Centralized maintenance
- Best for most clients

### Client-Hosted Platform:
- Dockerized container system
- Infrastructure-as-code (Terraform)
- Suited for enterprise/secure environments

**Tools**: Docker, Kubernetes, GitHub Actions, Terraform, Helm

---

## Step 4: Build a Client-Facing Portal or API

Use **React** or **Dash** to provide:
- Upload portal for model outputs or RTK data
- Real-time dashboards and reports
- API access for integration with existing tools

**Optional**: Settle3 plugins or GIS connectors for ArcGIS/QGIS

---

## Step 5: Create a Repeatable Delivery Process

Build a delivery playbook including:
- ✅ Deployment scripts (Docker/Helm)
- ✅ Onboarding checklist
- ✅ Training guides
- ✅ Pretrained models & retraining scripts
- ✅ Monthly/quarterly report templates

---

## Step 6: Define Support, SLA, and Change Requests

### Support Tiers:
1. **Basic**: Email, 72hr response
2. **Standard**: Email + Slack, 24hr response
3. **Premium**: Slack + Phone + fast-patch support

### Additional Services:
- Regular model retraining
- Data format adaptation
- Feature request process
- Annual license renewal

---

## Step 7: Position It in the Market

### Sales Material:
- 1-page product summary
- Use-case demo video
- Before/after time savings chart
- ROI calculator (Excel or web)
- Customizable pilot proposal template
