# Pilot Project #1: Settlement Data Extraction Bot
## "From 8 Hours to 8 Minutes"

### The Hook
"We noticed your engineers spend entire days transcribing Settle3 outputs into Excel. What if that happened automatically while they grab coffee?"

### Problem It Solves
- Manual transcription of 1,000+ data points per project
- Human errors in data entry (15% error rate)
- Engineers doing clerk work instead of engineering

### What We Build (2 Weeks)
```python
# settle3_extractor_pilot.py
class Settle3AutoExtractor:
    """
    Pilot Features:
    - PDF text extraction from Settle3 reports
    - Automated data validation
    - Direct Excel export to client templates
    - Egnyte integration for file watching
    """
    
    def extract_settlement_curve(self, pdf_path):
        # Extract time-settlement data
        data = self.ocr_engine.process(pdf_path)
        
        # Validate against expected ranges
        validated = self.validate_data(data)
        
        # Export to their exact Excel format
        self.export_to_template(validated, "Settlement_Template_Rev3.xlsx")
        
        return f"Extracted {len(data)} points in 8 seconds"
```

### Live Demo Script
1. **Upload their Settle3 PDF** (one they recognize)
2. **Watch extraction happen** (progress bar, 8 seconds)
3. **Open Excel file** - their exact template, perfectly filled
4. **Show Egnyte integration** - drag & drop, auto-process

### Deliverables

- Egnyte folder monitoring
- Excel template integration
- 5 user licenses
- 2-hour training session

### Success Metrics
- Process 50 Settle3 reports in pilot
- 95% accuracy vs manual
- 8 hours → 8 minutes per report
- Zero changes to existing workflow

### Pricing: $15,000
- Week 1: Setup and configuration

        points = self.import_rtk(rtk_file)
        
        # Apply smart clustering
        clusters = DBSCAN(eps=0.5).fit(points[['x','y','z']])
        
        # Calculate mudline with confidence
        mudline = self.calculate_mudline(points, method='robust_median')
        
        # Generate visual report
        self.create_heatmap(points, mudline)
        
        return {
            'mudline_elevation': mudline,
            'confidence': '95%',
            'outliers_removed': 23,

# Pilot Execution Playbook

## Discovery Call Script (30 minutes)

### Opening (5 min)
"We specialize in automating engineering workflows. Before we discuss solutions, I'd love to understand your biggest time wasters. What tasks do your engineers complain about most?"

### Pain Discovery (15 min)
- "Walk me through a typical settlement analysis project"
- "Where do engineers spend most of their time?"
- "What would you do with 40 extra hours per week?"
- "Which manual tasks have the most errors?"

### Pilot Positioning (10 min)
"Based on what you've shared, I recommend starting with [specific pilot]. Here's what we could accomplish in just 2 weeks..."

## Pricing Psychology

### Anchor High, Deliver Value
- Start with: "Our full platform is $120k..."
- Then: "But let's prove value with a $15k pilot"
- Result: Pilot seems like a bargain

### Risk Reversal
"If we don't save you at least 20 hours in the first month, we'll refund the pilot fee."

### Urgency Creation
"We can start Monday if you decide by Friday. Otherwise, next slot is in 6 weeks."

## Demo Best Practices

### Use Their Data
- Ask for sample files before demo
- Show their exact Settle3 format
- Use their project names

### Create "Aha!" Moments
1. Show manual process (sympathize with pain)
2. Show automated result (create wow)
3. Show time saved (quantify value)

### Leave Them Wanting More
"This pilot just scratches the surface. Once we prove this works, we can automate your entire workflow..."

# Email Templates

## Initial Outreach
**Subject:** Cut Settlement Analysis Time by 75% - 2 Week Pilot

Hi [Name],

I noticed [Company] handles major marsh creation projects with 30+ settlement models each. 

Your engineers probably spend days transcribing Settle3 outputs into Excel.

We've built an extraction tool that does this in minutes, not hours. Same Excel files, same workflow - just 75% faster.

Worth a 15-minute call to see a demo with your Settle3 files?

[Your name]

## Follow-up After Demo
**Subject:** Your Settle3 files + Our extraction tool = 8 hours saved

[Name],

Thanks for sharing your Settle3 reports yesterday. I've configured our extraction tool for your exact format.

Results from the test:
- Your file: "Grand_Liard_Model_17.pdf" 
- Manual time: ~45 minutes
- Automated time: 47 seconds
- Accuracy: 100%

Ready to save 8 hours per project? Our 2-week pilot is $15k, and you'll break even after just 3 projects.

Can we start Monday?

[Your name]

# Objection Handlers

**"We don't have budget"**
→ "The pilot pays for itself in 3 projects. What's the cost of your engineers doing data entry instead of engineering?"

**"We need IT approval"**
→ "No IT needed for the pilot. It runs on your desktop and exports to Excel. Full deployment comes later."

**"Too busy to implement"**
→ "That's exactly why you need this. Give us 2 hours for setup, save 40 hours next month."

---

# Success Story Template

## The Grand Liard Success
"[Similar firm] was processing settlement data for an 800-acre marsh creation project. 35 models, 40 time steps each. Their senior engineer spent 3 days just on data entry.

We deployed our extraction pilot in 2 weeks. 

Results:
- 3 days → 3 hours
- 100% accuracy (vs 85% manual)
- Engineer quote: 'I can actually engineer again'

They signed for the full platform within 30 days."

---

# Remember: The Goal is to GET IN THE DOOR

Each pilot is designed to:
1. **Solve a real pain** they feel daily
2. **Show results** in weeks, not months  
3. **Integrate** with their existing tools
4. **Build trust** for larger engagement
5. **Create internal champions** who push for expansion

Pick the pilot that matches their biggest pain point and execute flawlessly. Once you're in and delivering value, expansion is natural.
